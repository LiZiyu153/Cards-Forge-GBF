/**
 * Headless regression test for Big Bertha (GBF) conditional cost reduction:
 * "Big Bertha costs {2} less to cast if an opponent controls creatures with
 * total toughness 6 or greater."
 *
 * Original bug (fixed in 0.0.1.6): SVar:X was "Count$Min 2 0/CompareY GE6.1.0"
 * — "Min 2 0" is not an xCount function and "CompareY" is not a doXMath
 * operator, so X silently evaluated to 0 and the reduction NEVER applied.
 * Fixed with the official Orysa, Tide Choreographer pattern:
 *   S:Mode$ ReduceCost | ... | Amount$ 2 | CheckSVar$ X | SVarCompare$ GE6
 *   SVar:X:Count$Valid Creature.OppCtrl$CardToughness
 * These tests run the real CostAdjustment.adjust() path (the same code path
 * the game uses when paying for the spell) and assert the adjusted CMC.
